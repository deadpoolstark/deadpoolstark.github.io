        <img src="Delorean.png" width="70%" height="50%" alt="img didnt work plz fix ffs.">
        <p>This "thing" is a cult classic called a delorean dmc 12. This one is one of the best retro-futristic cars on the planet, and also this is one of the reasons why it is in the back to the future series. This car was made by and for one person, John Delorean. Everything in this car is what John Delorean wanted, from a secret compartment to hide his weed to a door that looks cool when opened. John Delorean was the founder of DMC (Delorean Motor Company) and the DMC 12 is the 12th iteration of their first car. This car is a power pack it has a V6 and can go upto like ____ km/h although the speedometer says 85 is the max. This was because of rising fuel prices and trying to make the car economic by making ppl drive under that speed.</p>
